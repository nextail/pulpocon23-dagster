## Welcome to Dagster Workshop

Dagster is an OpenSource tool that eliminates the barrier between development and operation, and at the same time brings business processes closer. We will discuss its basic concepts and develop a complete data pipeline applying them, always keeping the data in the foreground.

## Let's Start

You will start by reading the [Introduction](doc/README.md), where you will have access to all the chapters of the workshop as well as information about the workshop requirements.
